6 sided die readme file.

For the playing and merryment associated with snakes and ladders, seriously who got those two together in their head? It's in .obj format with different textures so you can change the colour and have multiple dice. It also has a bump/dispalcement map, and a shinyness map.

I'd really love to see what people create with these, and if anyone asks, I'd really appreciate you letting them know where it came from, so if they want some other stuff, I can get repeat offenders... I mean repeat work. ^_^

Please attribute me in some way. I created these and it took time, and patience to produce.
